#Insights based on Non-Graphical and Visual Analysis:

⮚ The most popular films are international movies, dramas, and comedies.
⮚ The countries at the forefront of content creation on Netflix include the USA, India, UK, Canada, and
France.
⮚ The majority of top-rated content on Netflix is designed for mature viewers, with R-rated content
intended for audiences aged 14 and above, as well as those who may need parental guidance.
⮚ The most viewed content in our dataset typically ranges from 80 to 100 minutes in duration. This
timeframe is primarily associated with movies and shows that consist of a single season.
⮚ Our content distribution maintains a ratio of 70% movies to 30% TV shows..
⮚ Anupam Kher, SRK (Shah Rukh Khan), Julie Tejwani, Naseeruddin Shah, and Takahiro Sakurai hold
the highest positions in the list of Most Watched content.
⮚ The number of original content releases that subsequently became available on Netflix saw an
increase from 1980 to 2020, although this trend later experienced a decline, likely attributed to the
impact of COVID-19.
⮚ TV shows on Netflix featuring international content, dramas, and comedy genres enjoy widespread
popularity.
⮚ The United States holds a prominent position in both TV shows and movies, with the UK also
delivering impressive content in both categories. Interestingly, India has a stronger presence in
movies compared to TV shows.
⮚ Furthermore, the volume of movies produced in India exceeds the combined count of TV shows
and movies from the UK, as India secured the second position in the overall content sum on
Netflix.
⮚ Hence, it is reasonable to deduce that the popular ratings on Netflix encompass content suitable for
mature audiences, including those aged over 14 or over 17.
⮚ In the realm of movies, the most common durations fall within the ranges of 80-100, 100-120, and
120-150 minutes. This suggests that the optimal range for movie lengths could indeed be around 80
to 150 minutes.
⮚ Bollywood actors like Anupam Kher, SRK (Shah Rukh Khan), and Naseeruddin Shah hold significant
popularity within the realm of movies available on Netflix.
⮚ Rajiv Chilka, Jan Suter, Raul Campos, and Suhas Kadav are esteemed directors who have garnered
popularity in the world of movies.
⮚ Until 2019, the content library on Netflix experienced a consistent growth trajectory. However, the
emergence of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 impacted the movie category more significantly than
TV shows. Subsequently, in 2021, there was a notable reduction in content across both TV shows
and movies.
⮚ A substantial influx of movies is observed on Netflix during the initial week and final month of the
current year, as well as the opening month of the subsequent year.
⮚ Dramas, Comedy, Kids 'TV Shows, International TV Shows, and Docuseries, Genres are popular in TV
Series in the USA
⮚ Dramas, Comedies, Documentaries, Family Movies, and Action Genres in Movies are popular in the
USA.
⮚ So, it seems plausible to conclude that the popular ratings across Netflix include Mature Audiences
and those appropriate for over 14/over 17 ages in both Movies and TV Shows in the USA.
⮚ Across movies, 80-100,100-120 is the range of minutes for which most movies lie. So quite possibly
80-120 minutes is the sweet spot we would be wanting for movies in the USA.

⮚ Vincent Tong, Grey Griffin, and Kevin Richardson are the most popular actors across TV Shows in the
USA
⮚ TV Shows are added to Netflix by a tremendous amount in July and September in the USA
⮚ Movies are added to Netflix in the USA by a tremendous amount in the first week/last month of the
current year and the first month of next year.
⮚ In the USA, though both Movies and Shows have reduced in 2021, the amount of decrease in the
number of TV Shows is small as compared to Movie.
